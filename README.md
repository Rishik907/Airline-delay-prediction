Flight-delay-prediction

Introduction
Every year approximately 20% of airline flights are delayed or cancelled, costing travellers over 20 billion dollars in lost time and money. Many factors affect flight delays including air traffic control backups, equipment delays, weather, late reaching aircraft to be used for the flight from previous flight, maintenance and security issues. One of the important modern life challenges of airports and airline agencies is ﬂight delay. In addition, delay in ﬂight makes passengers concerned and this matter causes extra expenses for the agency and the airport itself. These delays not only cause inconvenience to the airlines, but also to passengers In this project I will look at different ML algorithms including MLP Neural Networks to try to predict if a flight will be delayed or not.
